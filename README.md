### Hey there, I'm 7-falseparfait 

People often ask me, *"Why falseparfait?"*—and my answer? *"Because it has no meaning, just falseparfait."* 😆

- 🚀 I’m currently learning **React** and rebuilding some of my side projects, like my eCommerce website originally built with Vanilla JS.
- 🦀 I'm also exploring **Rust**, aiming to expand my knowledge beyond JavaScript.
- 📚 Always eager to learn and build cool things on the web.

💬 Let's connect and build something amazing together!
